This is my implementation of learing to build web application using golang by following the getting started page 
at https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/

To save binary file inside bin directory create the directory and build using:
go build -o bin wiki.go

Run using:
bin\wiki.exe

Access a file using: http://localhost:8080/view/REPLACE-ME-PAGE-NAME
Example: http://localhost:8080/view/test


Files will be saved inside a directory called "data".
